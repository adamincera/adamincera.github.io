			<p>My name is Adam Incera, and I'm a senior at Columbia University majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Mechanical Engineering. I'm focusing my studies on low-level software and security. I also enjoy computer architecture, logic design, modern art, and rock climbing.</p>
			<p>I spent this summer doing web development at <a href='http://amazonrobotics.com'>Amazon Robotics</a>. I built a 3D visualization tool using <a href=threejs.org>Three.js</a> and integrated it into an existing internal webapp on an <a href=emberjs.com>Ember</a> framework with a Java backend. Outside of work, I spent my free time learning to climb things at <a href='http://www.bostonrockgym.com/'>Boston Rock Gym</a>.</p>
			<p><i>"How did you get into engineering?"</i></p>
			<p>I decided I wanted to be an engineer in my first year of high school. I got my first taste of physics when I was in ninth grade. We learned about projectile motion, and we worked through an example problem involving calculating where a model rocket would land, given its initial velocity and position. I had been building model rockets religiously since I was in the fourth grade, and when this example problem came up it suddenly occurred to me that if I pursued engineering, I could apply the math and science that I had learned in school to real, tangible things to build them better than I could before.</p>
			<p>Having narrowed my potential career paths down to "building things that move," I entered Columbia's engineering school in 2012 dead-set on studying mechanical engineering. The summer after my freshman year, I took an intro computer science course. Amazed by how quickly we began writing our own code and building our first small pieces of software, I began considering changing majors to CS.</p>
			<p>That fall, I ran into some problems with my laptop that required me to open it up to change the RAM. When I saw the circuitry on the motherboard and graphics card, my mind was absolutely blown by the realization that a computer is nothing more than an incredibly complicated circuit. I decided to take an introductory circuits course the following semester, and enjoyed it so much that I decided to change majors in Computer Engineering. Over the next year and a half, I determined that low-level software and computer architecture provided the best balance between my interests in computer hardware and programming. That's what I've focused my studies on since then, and that's the field in which I plan to pursue a career.</p>
