			<h3><i>RSA Box</i></h3>
			<p>This past spring, I programmed an FPGA to perform hardware-accelerated RSA encryption. This project was my group's final project for CSEE W4840: Embedded Systems with <a href=www.cs.columbia.edu/~edwards>Professor Stephen Edwards</a>. My responsibilities were to first design and implement a modular multiplication circuit, and then to design and implement a datapath that used the multiplication block to perform modular exponentiation. I was able to optimize the modular multiplication block to multiply two 128-bit integers on a 128-bit modulus in 257 clock cycles (2 clock cycles per bit, plus 1 clock cycle of boilerplate). The exponentiation block performed exponentiation in O(n) time where n is the bit length of the exponent. The <a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/4840/reports/RSAB.pdf>report</a> and <a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/4840/reports/RSAB.tar.gz>tarballed source code</a> are posted on the <a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/4840/index.html>course page</a>. This project is also <a href=https://github.com/ohEmily/RSA_accelerator>on GitHub</a>.</p>
			<h3><i>DoorTroll</i></h3>
			<p>In January, I went to winter PennApps with a couple of my friends from school. We built the DoorTroll, an Intel Edison-powered device that allows the user to open a door remotely. First, the DoorTroll is attached to the inside of the door, and a piece of twine is tied from the spool on the device to the door handle. The board runs a Node.js server and, when a user enters their credentials, the board activates a motor that turns the spool and pulls down on the door handle, opening the door. The device was designed to allow students to get into their dorm rooms if they're locked out, or to allow other people to access their room when they aren't around. On this project, I was in charge of physical design. I built the spool in Creo Parametric and printed it on a MakerBot the hackathon organizers made available to us. I also built a case in Creo, but upon trying to print it realized it wouldn't finish in time. Instead, we found an acryllic box and mounted the edison board and spool inside it.</p>
			<h3><i>Jiralytics</i></h3>
			For the second half of the summer after my sophomore year, I interned at <a href=http://www.gilt.com>the Gilt Groupe</a> on the mobile devlopment team. I spent my time there building a Clojure library to pull, sort, and perform statistical analysis on data from JIRA's REST API. The goal of this project was to allow the mobile development team to streamline their issue handling by determining what types of issues each team member was handling, how long they took, how many were resolved, and how many issues were left unresolved longer than they should have. This project is published on <a href=http://github.com/adamincera/jiralytics>my GitHub page</a>.
